# OpenAI Chatbot

This is a simple OpenAI chatbot implementation using Node.js. It takes user input from the command line and gets a response from the OpenAI API in the command line.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- An OpenAI API key. You can get one by signing up on the [OpenAI website](https://platform.openai.com/).

## Read Documentation here

-https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your OpenAI API key:

   ```env
   API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the script using Node.js:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Enter your prompt when prompted. The script will send your input to the OpenAI API and print the response.

## Code Overview

The script does the following:

1. Loads environment variables from a `.env` file using the `dotenv` package.
2. Imports the `OpenAI` class from the `openai` package and the `readline` module from Node.js.
3. Initializes an instance of `OpenAI` with the API key.
4. Uses the `readline` interface to take user input from the command line.
5. Sends the user input to the OpenAI API and prints the response.
6. Suppresses deprecation warnings by setting `process.noDeprecation` to `true`.

## Example

```bash
$ node script.js
Please enter your prompt: Hello, how are you?
I'm just a program, so I don't have feelings, but I'm here to help you!
```

## Error Handling

The script includes basic error handling to catch and display errors related to the OpenAI API.

## Suppressing Deprecation Warnings

To suppress deprecation warnings, the script sets `process.noDeprecation` to `true`.

```javascript
process.noDeprecation = true;
```

## Dependencies

- `dotenv`: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.
- `openai`: The official OpenAI API client for Node.js.
- `readline`: A Node.js module for reading lines of text from a readable stream.
